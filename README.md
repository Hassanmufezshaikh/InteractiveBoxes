## üìù Description

This project features an interactive "Bundle & Save" product selection interface, common in e-commerce websites. It allows users to choose from different product bundles (e.g., 1 Pair, 2 Pair, 3 Pair), view details, select options like size and color for individual items within a bundle, and see a dynamically updated total price. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiple Bundle Options:** Users can select different quantity bundles (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 pairs).
* **Interactive Selection:** Clicking on a bundle option highlights it and expands/collapses its detailed selection area.
* **"Most Popular" Badge:** A visually distinct badge highlights a recommended bundle option.
* **Dynamic Price Update:** The total price automatically updates based on the selected bundle.
* **Item Customization:** For multi-item bundles, users can select individual sizes and colors via dropdowns.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing experience on various screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
